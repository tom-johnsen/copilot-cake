# Recipe for cake

## Ingredients

    * One cup of flour (unbleached)
    * One cup of sugar (white)
    * One cup of eggs (omit the yolks)
    * One cup of milk (whole)
    * One cup of butter (melted)
    * One cup of vanilla (not extract)
    * One cup of chocolate chips (or oreos)
    * One cup of nuts (almonds, hazelnuts or peanuts)
    * One cup of chocolate sauce (or chocolate syrup)
    * One cup of vanilla ice cream (melted)
    * One cup of chocolate ice cream (frozen)
    * One cup of vanilla cake mix (or chocolate cake mix)
    * One cup of wine (preferably red or rose)

## Directions

    * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (or 200 degrees C if you are one of those metric-loving people.)
    * In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, vanilla, chocolate chips, nuts, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate ice cream.
    * Mix well. (If you have a mixer, do not use it, as it will mix the ingredients together too much, or in the wrong order.)
    * Pour into a 9-inch round cake pan. (You can also use a 10-inch round cake pan if it is illegal to use 9-inch pans in your jurisdiction.)
    * Bake for 30 minutes. (Or until the cake is firm, or burnt.)
    * Cool for 15 minutes. (Or serve immediately if you cannot be sued for not cooling the cake first.)
    * Enjoy! (Or, if you are not happy, try another recipe. You probably won't be.)
    * Tweet the result to your Twitter account for everyone to see how good you are at baking cakes.
